I found it's more easy to set "PYTHONPATH" enviroment variable to the top folder:

bash$ export PYTHONPATH=/PATH/TO/APP
then:

import sub1.func1
#...more import
of course, PYTHONPATH is "global", but it didn't raise trouble for me yet.



git clone ssh://5904f6e57628e14cb3000166@buchbot-denmak.rhcloud.com/~/git/buchbot.git/
cd buchbot/

git add .
git commit -m 'My changes'
git push


To clone the sample application so that you have a local version of the code that you can then deploy to Heroku, execute the following commands in your local command shell or terminal:
$ git clone https://github.com/heroku/python-getting-started.git
$ cd python-getting-started
You now have a functioning git repository that contains a simple application as well as a requirements.txt file, which is used by Pythonâ€™s dependency manager, Pip.
